                I like to build things with web technologies. 
                I started programming in my downtime as a hobby and it eventually turned into a career.
                Through my work as a software engineer, I strive to create robust, accessible and performant applications that are empowering to all users.
            </p>
            <p>
                I'm open to job opportunites where I can solve interesting problems and further expand my skill set as an engineer. 
                Feel free to check out my <a id="resume" href="assets/NathanCobbettResume.pdf" target="_blank">resume</a> and get in touch.

                When I'm not on my computer I like spending time in the woods, retro gaming and bouldering.
                I also enjoy taking pictures as a hobby and help run a small photography business. 
                A few samples of my photos can be found here.
